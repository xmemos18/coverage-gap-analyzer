**Data Saved:** Only on your device

### Before You Start

Gather this information:

✅ ZIP codes for all your residences
✅ Ages of all household members
✅ Current insurance details (if you have coverage)
✅ Approximate monthly budget

## Using the Calculator

### Step 1: Your Residences

**What to enter:**
- Minimum 2 residences required
- Maximum 5 residences allowed
- ZIP code and state for each

**Example:**
```
Primary Residence:
- ZIP: 33101 (Miami, FL)
- State: Florida

Secondary Residence:
- ZIP: 10001 (New York, NY)
- State: New York
```

**Tips:**
- Enter actual ZIP codes, not city names
- ZIP codes must be exactly 5 digits
- Select the correct state from dropdown
- Use "Add Another Residence" for 3rd, 4th, or 5th home

**Common Errors:**
- ❌ "ZIP code must be 5 digits" → Enter all 5 numbers
- ❌ "State is required" → Select from dropdown

### Step 2: Your Household

**What to enter:**

**Adults (18+):**
- How many adults need coverage
- Age of each adult

**Children (0-17):**
- How many children need coverage
- Age of each child

**Medicare Eligibility:**
- Check if anyone is 65+ or Medicare-eligible

**Example:**
```
Adults: 2
- Adult 1: 67 years old
- Adult 2: 65 years old

Children: 0

Medicare Eligible: Yes ✓
```

**Tips:**
- Ages determine eligibility and costs
- Be accurate - estimates use these ages
- Medicare eligibility affects recommendations
- Anyone 65+ usually qualifies for Medicare

**Common Errors:**
- ❌ "Age must be at least 18" → Add as child if under 18
- ❌ "Age is required" → Enter age for each person

### Step 3: Current Insurance (Optional)

**What to enter:**
- Whether you have current insurance
- Insurance carrier name (e.g., "Blue Cross")
- Plan type (HMO, PPO, Medicare, etc.)
- Monthly premium cost
- Deductible amount
- Out-of-pocket maximum

**Why provide this?**
- Compare current plan to recommendations
- See potential savings
- Identify coverage gaps

**You can skip this step** if you don't have current insurance.

**Example:**
```
Current Insurance: Yes

Carrier: Blue Cross Blue Shield
Plan Type: PPO
Monthly Cost: $850
Deductible: $2,500
Out-of-Pocket Max: $8,000
```

**Tips:**
- Find info on insurance card or online portal
- Monthly cost is your premium (what you pay each month)
- Deductible is what you pay before insurance kicks in
- Leave optional fields blank if unsure

### Step 4: Your Budget

**Budget Ranges:**
- Under $500/month
