Hi everyone! 👋

Quick question for the snowbirds here - how do you handle health
insurance when you split time between two states?

I'm working on a tool to help people find coverage that actually
works across multiple states, and I'd love to get your input on
what's most frustrating about this.

Would anyone be willing to hop on a 10-minute call this week?
Happy to share early access in exchange!

### Reddit Post
```
[Question] How do you handle health insurance as a snowbird?

I split my time between NY (summer) and FL (winter) and I'm
constantly confused about whether my insurance will cover me
in both places.

How do others handle this? Do you:
- Just pick one state and hope for the best?
- Get two different plans?
- Go with Medicare Advantage?
- Something else?

Any tips appreciated!

P.S. I'm building a free calculator to help people in this situation -
DM if you want to try it out early and give feedback
```
